tide editor
===========

This is tide editor, a disassembler and editor focused on editing executable binaries and reverse engineering. It is a fork of the awesome [HT Editor](http://hte.sourceforge.net/). I had lots of ideas and features I wanted to implement into HT Editor, but the lack of modern source control and the level of maintenance were limiting factors preventing me from easily contributing back to the original project. Will this fork succeed or become useless or unnecessary? Only time will tell.
