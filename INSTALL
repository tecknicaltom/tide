 Installing HT
===============

(1)
    a. If you want a final (release) version (-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer) type:

	    ./configure

    b. If you want a development (debug) version of HT (-g -O0) do the 
	  following instead:

	    ./configure --disable-release

    c. if you want to build with profiling information (-pg -g) add 
	  '--enable-profiling'

(2) compile and link HT:

	    make
	    
(3) (optionally) install HT:

	    make install

(4) run HT:

	    ht or ./ht

Note: The package 'tex4ht' comes with a program called /usr/bin/ht which
      conflicts with this program's name...
      In order to use both programs properly you should rename one of them.
      (for example: mv /usr/local/bin/ht /usr/local/bin/ht.alt)
